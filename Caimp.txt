Spatial Evaluation order

A: Synchronic, always from the same corner.

D: Asynchronic, random with replacement.

E: Synchronic, starting from a random corner each time step.

Time Type

C: Continuous, one array of states, the cells feel the changes in
	the neighborhood inmediatly.

D: Discrete, two arrays of states (Actual state & Next State), the cells
	feel the changes in the neighborhood the next time step.

Event Type

1: The two events are independent of each other and occur at the same
	time

2: All cells in the array are considered for  exctinction events, then all 
	cells are considered for colonization only if survived.
 
3: The 2xNxN events are considered random without replacement.

4: The extinction event comes first and if the cell survives 
	a colonization event occurs.
